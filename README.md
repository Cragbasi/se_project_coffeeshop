# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is a webpage I created with HTML and CSS, based on a design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

The form needs to be completed on th Back-end: Basically, it needs to be made functional by programming it to collect, sort and store the user inputs.
